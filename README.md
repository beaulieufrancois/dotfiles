# Dotfiles

This is my ZSH configuration and personal dotfiles. Please review everything before you attempt to use them. Some things might be OS X specific, but I try to keep everything as platform-agnostic as possible. This is a public repository mostly for easy installs on additional machines, but feel free to take a look!

# Installation

1. Clone this repository in ~/.dotfiles, **with submodules**:

        git clone --recursive [this_repos_url] ~/.dotfiles

2. Run `./install` once (creates dotfile symlinks and such)

3. Open a new shell
